# Well... that didn't work out, didn't it?

In my latest (and first) blog post, I made plans for this blog which I didn't end up implementing. I haven't had enough time to properly maintain the blog this year yet, but I intend to revitalize it in the next couple of weeks, this time without promises or schedules that are impossible to meet.

One of the next posts is going to be about the projects I've been working on/experimenting, which might shed some light on my disappearence.

See you in the next one!
