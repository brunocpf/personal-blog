# First Post!

My initial idea was to just practice and learn Next.JS, but [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/your-words-are-wasted)'s tips and my boredom inspired me to develop and maintain a blog/portfolio.

So... welcome! I'm still not sure what I'm going to write about, but I intend to at least document some details about the development of this blog, which I made from "scratch" using Next.JS, and also of other projects I'm developing. I don't want to limit it to posts about programming, so maybe I'll do a few about my personal life as well? I don't consider myself to be a good writer or have an exceptionally exciting lifestyle, but it could be fun.

For now, I'll try to make about 2 to 4 posts a month (in English and Portuguese).

See you in the next one!
