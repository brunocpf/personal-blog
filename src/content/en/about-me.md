# About me

Hey, I'm Bruno!

I'm a software developer located in Belo Horizonte (MG), Brazil. I currently work full time as tech lead and software engineer, mainly of web apps, at a company in Belo Horizonte.

(Short) list of my interests and professional experiences as a developer, in no particular order:

- Web apps
- Mobile apps
- React, React Native
- TypeScript
- GraphQL
- Progressive Web Apps
- .NET Platforms
- Node.JS (Next.js, NestJS, express)
- Serverless
- SOA
- Domain Driven Design
- Software architecture
- Unity

Other than that... I like video games! Currently, playing Final Fantasy XIV a lot. üòÅ

I created this blog inspired by [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/your-words-are-wasted)'s tips... and a little bit of boredom haha. My goal is to post mainly about web development, my projects and the topics above, with a little bit of personal subjects sprinkled in.

I'm also open to develop projects. [Click here to get in touch, if you're interested!](/en/contact)
